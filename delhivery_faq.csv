Steps to view SC Dispatches?,"SC(Service centers) Dispatch on production is not visible from a tab SC-Pickorder as it is on staging, on production we can go to SC pickorder listing page via Eye dashboard: 
1.Open a SC center on eye dashboard. 2.Click on view pickup order button this will redirect you to pickorder listing page. 3.On Staging SC pickorder will be directly visible for center GGN_SC(INHRABDK). 4.For creating Normal Dispatches is pretty straight forward flow on DC’S, there is no concept such as Route id,route name, pickorder etc"
What are SC Dispatches in Delhivery?,"SC covers very large areas(and also their sizes are comparatively bigger than DC’s) thats why there is concept of routes introduced for SC centers. Basically On SC centers for before creating SC dispatches, we create an extra layer called as pickorder.(which will be explained later). SC generally handles B2B shipments which can have large MPS lots(upto 1200 child waybills). B2B means Business to Business shipments"
What is MPS Lot in SC?,"MPS lot - Multiple shipments of same products/consignee/business makes one lot which is known as mps lot (we assign on of the shipment as master of lot)"
Why we have concept of route id in SC?,"To save time and energy from having more to and fro motion, we have introduced the concept of routes add all available packages lying on one particular routes in one particular dispatch(having pickorder associated) and send the particular vehicle to that route, this will save money,time and energy(as we will not required to do to and fro motion for delivering packages)
Also when packages are delivered through DC’s which generally covers small areas, then usually FE’s also know about the localities and places very well, but for SC’s usually this is not the case because as SC covers large area then it is not possible for FE’s to know the areas personally thats why concept of route help them deliver the packages easily and efficiently 
To verify this statement, query a dispatch having pickorder_id associated to it and query a cluster_id of all packages in it you will find all having same cluster_id which is actually a route_id at our end"
What is pick-order concept?,"1.The concept of pickorder is that, basically we are creating an extra layer of pickorder for bifurcating all the packages lying on a particular route before adding them to WIP dispatch or associating a dispatch to it
2.Now before adding the packages to pickorder we need to putaway them. In technical terms we need assign an spid(space id format Z1.R1.B2) to packages, which ensures the  physical presence of package in SC centers
3.In terms of business logic (on ground operations) it is process of putting the packages to a particular space assigned to them in the center, basically we have multiple zones and each zones divided into several rows, this process is mainly done by JL’S (jammu loaders)
4.It is very important to assign spid to packages because it makes them easy in finding them before Adding to Dispatch
5.Also we have a check that if you will not putaway the packages then you will not be allowed to make pickorders
6.Doing putaway ensures that package should be physically present in center before creating pickorder
7.Spid is basically used to locate or find the packages in SC centers which are generally bigger in size
8.When you will visit the center then you will see many cages and pallets(these are nothing but used in process of sorting the shipments) lying in all zones in particular spid onto which packages are placed(pallets and cages are basically a platform which are moved from here and their by JL’s using a small movable machine),
9.So basically spid makes the process of finding packages less tiring 
10.Now after the pickorder is created and packages are added into the pickorder then we create a WIP dispatch associated with pickorder from the pickorder listing page where we show all created and inprogress status pickorders
11.Now here a comes another concept of pick api , technically this api is used to enable the button on 5th screen so that we can add the packages in WIP dispatch if we talk about what happening on ground then pick api process is of picking the packages from their respective space id and placing them at the DOCK from where OFD vehicle will depart
12.After the packages arrive here then they are added into the dispatch and placed into vehicle from DOCK for Out for Delivery
13.the centers with 'SC' in facility_type key in center table, then that all centers are eligible for creating dipatches via pickorder
sometimes you can also create normal dispatch on SC centers then how these both are managed actually center table has a key flare_flms_enabled on it
14.If flare_flms_enabled is True => only SC dispatches are allowed
15.if flare_flms_enbaled is False, None, Null Allow both dispatches
16.we have a update-facility lambda which has two trigger one msk topic and another SNS topic,
17.we are listening to this flare-flms-enabled key via this SNS topic(faas-dynamo-PartnerAppMeta-prod-topic) and rest of the keys updates are listened through this kafka topic(Prod.FAAS.Facility.info)"
